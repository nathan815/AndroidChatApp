# AndroidChatApp
This is a simple chat application for Android that I built for learning purposes.

It's powered by Firebase.

## Running/Building
To build this application, you can clone this repository and open it in Android Studio.

You'll need to first create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com and then [download the google-services.json file](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592).
Place the file in the `app/` directory.
